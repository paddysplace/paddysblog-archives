Ok, here it is. Had some trouble connecting to Zara`s computer from
mine to get the pics; so had to do it from the laptop which worked
fine...hmm. Very strange. Anyway. As we`ve had birthday cakes for
myself and my dad then I though it was my mums turn.

She is a huge Wallace & Gromit fan so I was quite easy picking a theme
for her cake!
